# Resources for Data Science (mainly for R users)


I have not read all of these books yet, but I come back to them and advise them regularly to learn more and complete any project.

Thus, **this list serves as a central spot to continually return to**, learn more, and as a reminder of essential information that one might forget.
Having them all in an easily accessible (updated) list is vital and a great advantage. 


Lastly, all the material is mostly relatively recent and online free resources, distributed in a "read first, buy later" principle. Hence, it becomes clear that you don't have to spend lots, if any, money to get into a high level of data science.



### General Data Science concepts and R

- [Statistical Inference for Data Science - A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse](https://moderndive.com/) (Book)

  *This book assumes no prerequisites: no algebra, no calculus, and no prior programming/coding experience. This is intended to be a gentle introduction to the practice of analyzing data and answering questions using data the way data scientists, statisticians, data journalists, and other researchers would.*
  
- [Yet Again: R + Data Science](https://yards.albert-rapp.de/index.html) (Book)

  *This book is an accumulation of lecture notes revolving around many introductory R and Data Science books.*

- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) (Book)

  *Everything about R Markdown - use as a reference when needed.*
  
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (Book)

  *This book will teach you how to do data science with R - Everything related to R and Data Science best practices.*

- [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) (Book)

  *The book is designed primarily for R users who want to improve their programming skills and understanding of the language.*

- [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) (Book)

  *In this book you'll learn how to turn your code into packages that others can easily download and use.*

### Machine Learning

- [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book](http://themlbook.com/) (Book)

  *This book contains only those parts of the vast body of material on machine learning developed since the 1960s that have proven to have a significant practical value. A beginner in machine learning will find in this book just enough details to get a comfortable level of understanding of the field and start asking the right questions.*

- [Hands-On Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) (Book)

  *This book provides hands-on modules for many of the most common machine learning methods.*

- [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/index.html#summary) (Book)

  *This book is about making machine learning models and their decisions interpretable.*
  
- [Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/) (Book)

  *The goal of this book is to help practitioners build better models by focusing on the predictors.*
  
- [Tidy Modeling with R](https://www.tmwr.org/) (Book)  

  *This book is a guide to using a collection of software in the R programming language for model building called tidymodels.*

- [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/) (Book)
        
  *This book focuses on supervised or predictive modeling for text, using text data to make predictions about the world around us.*
  
### Big Data and Scale in R

- [Mastering Spark with R](https://therinspark.com/) (Book)

  *In this book you will learn how to use Apache Spark with R. The book intends to take someone unfamiliar with Spark or R and help you become proficient by teaching you a set of tools, skills and practices applicable to large-scale data science.*
  
### Applications and R shiny  
  
- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) (Book)
 
  *This book is designed to take you from knowing nothing about Shiny to being an expert developer who can write large complex apps that are still maintainable and performant.*
  
- [The Shiny AWS Book](https://business-science.github.io/shiny-production-with-aws-book/) (Book)

  *This book is teaching Data Scientists how to deploy, host, and maintain web applications.*

### Version Control - Github

- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) (Book)

  *The use of Git/GitHub in data science has a slightly different vibe from that of pure software development, due to differences in the user's context and objective. Happy Git aims to complement existing, general Git resources by highlighting the most rewarding usage patterns for data science.*
  
- [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) (Online article)

  *This article describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents.*
  
### Deployment and Reproducibility with Containers in R

- [https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/](https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/) (Online material)

  *A quick introduction on using Docker for reproducibility in R.*
  
- [Reproducible Work in R](https://towardsdatascience.com/reproducible-work-in-r-e7d160d5d198) (Online article)

  *Why & How to use Docker in your daily R workflow*

### Other Resources

- [Tidy Tuesday Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

  *A weekly social data project in R. Great datasets and a lot of great inspiration for visualizations and code from the R community. You can check the twitter tag [here](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&src=typeahead_click)*
  
- [Julia Silge blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/)
  
  *Machine learning, text analysis, and more*
